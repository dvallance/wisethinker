      I just released my [JsonObject](/json-object/index) project to RubyGems.

      During the process of building this site I decided to use a JSON backend to store all my *listings*. Therefore I wanted a better way to work with JSON then simply using JSON Hashes directly.  As a result I built JsonObject which can be used to quickly represent a JSON structure with custom classes/objects. I think it works really well and wanted to share it!

      ...if you happen to try it out I would love to hear your opinions ;)
