      **Note:** _as I’m testing different behaviours, changing config settings, etc; I seem to end up in a state where things stop working properly. When this happens, the output from Jeykll doesn’t seem to help me identify what I changed to cause a problem or exactly what the issue is. I strongly suggest you use a source control system, such as git, to be able to revert to a previous working state._

      As I stated in my first post on Jeykll, I want to understand the naming conventions of posts and figure out how to change them.

  - title: Default Behaviour
    body: |
      It appears that your posts must be named in the following format or they will not function properly.

      <pre>
      <code class="language-bash">year-month-day-title.format (e.g. 2012-01-05-my-opinion-on-somthing.textile)</code>
      </pre>

      I really didn’t want the date in the filename itself, but since you can override it in the YAML Front Matter I guess its not that big of a deal (still I dislike it, as the day I actually publish a post is usually not the day I start writing it).

  - title: Permalinks
    body: |
      Permalink is the terminology Jeykll uses for how your site’s URLs are generated.

      There are a few built-in styles to choose from (i.e date, pretty or none) but its very flexible and you can supply your own. I chose to go with /blog/:categories/:title for my posts.

      So in my _config.yml file I added:

      <pre>
      <code class="language-bash">permalink: /blog/:categories/:title</code>
      </pre>

      The part that is confusing is that the :title is replaced by the title part of the filename and doesn’t seem to take the :title value from the YAML Front Matter section. Which I hoped it would. So in other words the :title part of the url is directly tied to the filename and can’t be changed, unless you change the filename itself.

      So...

      <pre>
      <code class="language-bash">_posts/2012-03-05-my-cool-article.textile</code>
      </pre>

      with my permalink setting of...

      <pre>
      <code class="language-bash">permalink: /blog/:categories/:title</code>
      </pre>

      and a YAML Front Matter of...

      <pre>
      <code class="language-bash">---
      title: New Title Name
      categories: [ amazing, technology ]
      ---</code>
      </pre>

      produces a final url for that post of...

      <pre class="language-bash">
      <code class="language-bash">/blog/amazing/technology/my-cool-article/</code>
      </pre>

  - title: 'What Does Setting the :title Do Then?'
    body: |
      It comes into play when you want to use Template Data. When you access the post’s title via markup, such as {{ post.title }} it will have the “New Title Name” as declared above.

      I’m still learning the finer ins and outs of Jeykll so look out for future blogs. Tags and how to use them are still a mystery; that may be my next topic.
